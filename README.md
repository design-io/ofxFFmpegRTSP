# ofxFFmpegRTSP
Wrapper for ffmpeg and rtsp stream server and client.

A rtsp server is needed. 
rtsp-simpler-server is a good option. We have tested with v0.19.1. Download the binary for your file system from
https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server/releases/tag/v0.19.1

Run the server using `./rtsp-simple-server rtsp-simple-server.yml`

Compile and run the server example.
